							<p>Hello, my name is Faris. I was born in Bandung on 9th December 1993. I'm a software engineer and currently working for Xtremax Indonesia. 
								I'm passionately in love with software engineering because there are so many challenges in building a software with the best quality. I have
								a dream to contribute to my nation, Indonesia, through technology. I want to use my skills and knowledge to increase the
								Indonesian people's welfare. As a software engineer, I'm very happy when people use a software that I built and they feel helped by it. I also
								love to share my knowledge and I usually wrote them on my <a href="https://blog.faris.id" target="_blank">blog</a>. I'm open if you want me to
								share my knowledge to you privately or if you want me to be a speaker at your event. Just contact me via the email below. I will gladly 
								accept it if I think I have enough knowledge about the topic :)
							</p>
							<p>
								The first time I was interested in the IT world is when I was in junior high school. I was a gamer and played lot of games. One day, I played a game
								called Little Fighter 2. I really wanted to use a character which is the villain king in that game, but by default, that character is not available to choose. 
								I was curious and ended up going to the installation folder and open the files which can be opened by notepad LOL. I edited some files which I thought may
								have an impact to the game and then I restarted the game. And BOOM, I can use the character that I wanted haha. I was very happy and I thought that I was 
								successfully "hacking" the game XD
							</p>
							<p>
								The next thing that made me became more interested in IT world is when I have an internet connection at home. I remember it was 2009. At that time, I also went to vocational high school
								and took the <strong>Computer and Network Engineering </strong>major. I started my blog in 2009 and learn HTML & CSS because of it. I didn't know that there were
								many free templates available for Blogger. So, I modified the default template by myself haha. At school, I got many knowledge and skills about computer and networking.
								I learn the components of a PC and then I can assemble a PC. I learned to set up a local area network (LAN) and also wide area network (WAN). I also tried many operating systems besides Windows,
								such as Free BSD, Mikrotik, and many linux distros. I remember I even made my laptop quad boot by using Windows, Ubuntu, Slackware, and Backtrack. I did it on purpose, of course.
								I spent my 4 years in school using Linux. Most of the material are about networking. I remember I learned about IP, Netmask/Genmask, supernetting, subnetting, routing, building
								a DNS server, Proxy server, Mail server, etc. I honestly like them all but then I realize that these are not really my thing. I'm more into a software engineering rather than this 
								networking or IT infrastructure things. So, after I finished the school, I decided not to looking for a job. I wanted to go to college.
							</p>
							<p>
								In August 2013, I started my study at Bandung State Polytechnic (Polban). I took the <strong>Informatics</strong> major. In there, I learned all about software engineering 
								from the very basic. At first, programming is not easy for me but eventually I'm getting used to it and getting better and 
								better. I spent 4 years at Polban and those years are my most productive years ever. I got sooo many new knowledge and skills from my great 
								lecturers. I learned about many programming paradigms, study about data model (with SQL and NoSQL), analyze & design a software, dealing with 
								distributed environment, and so many other things. I'm very grateful that I was given a chance studied there. In 2017, I graduated from 
								Polban and unexpectedly, I received the honor as the best graduate in engineering. I really didn't expect to get that honor but I'm very happy, 
								of course. This is my greatest achievement in my life until today :)
							</p>
							<p>
								Aside from software engineering, I love sports, especially football. Until junior highschool, I still wanted to become a professional
								football player. But after I went to vocational highschool, I became more realistic haha. I ended up just making football as my hobby, not to
								be my profession. I have a dream to watch a world cup match live in the stadium. Hopefully someday I can make it true. Aamiin. 
								I also have an interest in music. I love playing guitar and singing. Some of my friends said that I have a good voice.
								They suggest me to become a professional singer but I don't want to. I think I'm not good enough to become a professional singer and
								also I love software engineering more than music because I think I can make a greater positive impact to other people if I become a 
								software engineer than a musician. I always remember these words <em><strong>"Khairunnas anfa'uhum linnas"</strong></em> which means 
								<em><strong>"The best of people are those that bring most benefit to the rest of mankind"</strong></em>. Those words got stuck into 
								my head since the first time I hear about it. It is written on my organization jacket when I was in vocational highschool. I'll never forget it. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I have a motto, <em><strong>"There's nothing you can't do if you mean it"</strong></em>. So, when I feel down, I try to remember my motto and 
								get up. I'm not a genius. I've been meeting some people who are smarter than me or considered as a genius. When they can do something, I believe
								I can do it too. The difference is that maybe they can do it faster than me. I'm not feeling inferior to them. I just have to try and learn two times,
								three times, or four times harder than them. The result would be the same or even better. So my message to you guys (and also myself), 
								Don't give up on your dreams! Find your passion, define your goals, and work as hard as you can to achieve that goals. Even if you don't reach
								your goals yet, trust me, you'll get an important lesson. Just keep learning and trying :)

									<h2>Aug 2016 - Dec 2016</h2>
									<h3>PT Ursabyte</h3>
									<p>I was an intern web developer at this company. The internship program is part of the curriculum at my college. 
										I spent 5 months with cool and fun guys. I also have friendly bosses here. I involved in some projects and 
										all those projects were using Java in the server side with spring framework. Previously, I already familiar with
										spring framework but still, of course, I learned many things and I've become more experienced using Java with this spring framework.
										One thing that I'll never forget is that I involved in a project where in that project I worked as a full-stack developer. Yes, I was
										working on both the back-end and the front-end side of the software. This is my first time I code JavaScript. I've faced HTML and CSS before but
										I've never code JavaScript. At first, I thought it was gonna be difficult, but after I learnt JavaScript and jQuery in one full day, 
										I was wrong. It was not that difficult and jQuery even make it easier for us, developer. I'm so glad that I met these guys, especially my boss.
										I was working directly with him and He gave me valuable lessons. Thanks Boss :D
									</p>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">So, to sum up, these are the technologies that I use when I was working at this company:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Java Programming Language</li>
										<li>Spring Framework</li>
										<li>Hibernate Framework</li>
										<li>DBMS : Oracle DB, PostgreSQL</li>
										<li>Application/Web Server : Oracle Weblogic, Tomcat</li>
										<li>Reporting : JasperReport</li>
										<li>Front-end things : HTML, CSS with Bootstrap Framework, JavaScript, jQuery</li>
									</ul>
